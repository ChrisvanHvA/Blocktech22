# Datebattle!
## The first application that lets you fight for the ones you may love.

produced by:
Chris Gabriel III

with datebattle, you get to choose a person who you fancy, and fight for their love! when you choose to duel
you will be assigned to another person who also chose to fight for this person, and engage in a 5-round battle
the person with the most points after 5 rounds wins!
the battle is based on the familiar game of rock paper scissors, but with some added styling and instructions
to keep it from being confusing for the players.

## installation:
this application is currently still a work in progress, although it is connected to a MongoDB and has heroku installed, the the database itself is still empty, but if you're an experienced developer send me a message to gain access to MongoDB
you can also download my full repository by using this command in git:
```
{
$git clone https://github.com/ChrisvanHvA/Blocktech22.git
} 
``` 
## Required packages
(if you want to get the full usability out of the code, you need to get a few packages within your node package manager:

- Mongodb
- Express
- Dotenv
- Heroku
- Ruby gem
all other online server features will be added shortly!
