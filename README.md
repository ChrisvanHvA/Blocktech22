# DateBattle!
## Chris Gabriel III

Introduction with datebattle, you get to choose a person who you fancy, and fight for their love! when you choose to duel you will be assigned to another person who also chose to fight for this person, and engage in a 5-round battle the person with the most points after 5 rounds wins! the battle is based on the familiar game of rock paper scissors, but with some added styling and instructions to keep it from being confusing for the players.

## installation:
this application is currently still a work in progress, although it is connected to a MongoDB and has heroku installed, the server doesnt respond to it yet. the only way to use it as of this moment is to run it locally on your machine. for that, all you have to do is to download this repository and open it up. when you open up the index.html file, you will be able to chose who you wanna fight for and engage in the duel!

### Required packages
(if you want to get the full usability out of the code, you need to get a few packages within your node package manager:

- Mongodb
- express
- dotenv
- heroku
- ruby gem
- all other online server features will be added shortly!
